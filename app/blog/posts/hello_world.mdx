hello everyone and welcome to my first ever blog!
## I wish...
overall i was very happy with my 2024. i feel ive set a solid foundation of who i am as a person and what excites me.
i want to continue down this path and explore everything the world has to offer and let my curiousity really guide me.
as a result i hope that in 2025 im able to learn a lot more about what it takes to be great, thus continuing my journey.
i hope to get into a great company and take as much knowledge away from that as possible.
i hope to have solved 1000 leetcode questions by the end of the year.
i hope to have prioritized my health.
i hope i have not let anything stop me from discovering and learning about something cool.
## My predictions for 2025
i believe i will finally take the next step i had been struggling to take since high school.
my prediction is also a mini market crash in the first bit of the year due to DOGE and people being mad about certain cuts, but long term i feel the us economy will be strong.
i also think crypto, bitcoin will explode. i also am interested in HBAR, seems pretty promising in terms of verifiable compute. 
overall very excitied about the cool stuff to come.
## Lessons of the past year
possibly the most important thing i learned was that i need to trust and believe in myself almost to the point of delision. 
all successful people are and although i may seem like an idiot by doing this the opposite has no potential to ever being great.
thus id rather have a 0.00001% chance than none.
## Conclusion
the last year has really retaught me the joys in life, both good and bad.
all i know is that curiousity is my compass and as long as i dont give up, i will end up somewhere i will be proud of.
